This document provides guidance and information for developing OpenShift Far Edge applications in compliance with commonly recognized industry standards and best practices for Cloud Native Functions (CNFs).

New releases, Github-pages deployments (HTML versions), PDF versions are triggered automatically upon commit to the main branch. 

It is therefore recommended to wait for the workflow actions (https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-best-practices/actions) to finish and auto generate a new release with the latest commits, then edit the release notes and version tag manually if so desired (instead of generating a manual release, which may cause issues preventing auto generation of the PDF/HTML files).

The latest release will be auto published (via Github-pages bot) to https://test-network-function.github.io/cnf-best-practices/

The latest (and previous) PDF versions can be downloaded from: https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-best-practices/releases


Contribution/PR Review Process: WIP

Commits will be subjected to PR review and approval by the CNF Best Practices team.

Owners of other private repos will be responsible for the review, approval, and maintenance of the content in their respective repos.



The entrypoint to this document is the `main.adoc` assembly file.

To build the HTML, install `podman`, and then:

```cmd
podman pull quay.io/redhat-docs/redhat-docs-template
podman cp $(podman run --detach quay.io/redhat-docs/redhat-docs-template):/assets ./assets
podman run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/docs:Z quay.io/redhat-docs/redhat-docs-template main.adoc
```

To build the PDF:

```cmd
podman pull quay.io/redhat-docs/redhat-docs-pdf-template
podman cp $(podman run --detach quay.io/redhat-docs/redhat-docs-pdf-template):/pdf-assets ./pdf-assets
podman run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/docs:Z quay.io/redhat-docs/redhat-docs-pdf-template main.adoc
```
