= Analyzing your application

To find out which capabilities the application needs, Red Hat has developed a SystemTap script (`container_check.stp`). With this tool, the CNF developer can find out what capabilities an application requires in order to run in a container. It also shows the syscalls which were invoked. See more info link:https://linuxera.org/capabilities-seccomp-kubernetes/[here]

Another tool is `capable` which is part of the BCC tools. It can be installed on RHEL8 with `dnf install bcc`.
