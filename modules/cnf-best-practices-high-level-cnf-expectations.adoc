== High-level CNF expectations

* CNFs shall be built to be cloud-native

* Containers MUST NOT run as root (uid=0). See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-security-context-non-root-user-check[access-control-security-context-non-root-user-check]

* Containers MUST run with the minimal set of permissions required. Avoid Privileged Pods. See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-security-context-privilege-escalation[access-control-security-context-privilege-escalation]

* Use the main CNI for all traffic - MULTUS/SRIOV/MacVLAN are for corner cases only (extreme throughput requirements, protocols that are unable to be load balanced)

* CNFs should employ N+k redundancy models (not applicable for Far Edge)

* CNFs MUST define their pod affinity/anti-affinity rules. See test cases link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-affinity-required-pods[lifecycle-affinity-required-pods], link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-pod-high-availability[lifecycle-pod-high-availability]

* All secondary network interfaces employed by CNFs with the use of MULTUS MUST support Dual-Stack IPv4/IPv6.

* Instantiation of CNF (via Helm chart or Operators or otherwise) shall result in a fully-functional CNF ready to serve traffic, without requiring any post-instantiation configuration of system parameters

* CNFs shall implement service resilience at the application layer and not rely on individual compute availability/stability

* CNFs shall decouple application configuration from Pods, to allow dynamic configuration updates

* CNFs shall support elasticity with dynamic scale up/down using kubernetes-native constructs such as ReplicaSets, etc. See test cases link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-crd-scaling[lifecycle-crd-scaling], link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-statefulset-scaling[lifecycle-statefulset-scaling], link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-deployment-scaling[lifecycle-deployment-scaling]

* CNFs shall support canary upgrades

* CNFs shall self-recover from common failures like pod failure, host failure, and network failure. Kubernetes native mechanisms such as health-checks (Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes) shall be employed at a minimum.
