= Setting SCC permissions for applications

Permissions to use an SCC is done by adding a cluster role that has _uses_ permissions for the SCC and then rolebindings for the users within a namespace to that role for users that need that SCC. Application admins can create their own role/rolebindings to assign permissions to a Service Account.
