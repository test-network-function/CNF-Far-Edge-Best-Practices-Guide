= Analyzing your application

To find out which capabilities the application needs, Red Hat has developed a SystemTap script (`container_check.stp`). With this tool, the workload developer can find out what capabilities an application requires in order to run in a container. It also shows the syscalls which were invoked.

Another tool is `capable` which is part of the BCC tools. It can be installed on RHEL8 with `dnf install bcc`.
