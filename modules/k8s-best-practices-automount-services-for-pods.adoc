= Automount services for pods

Pods which do not require API access should set the value of `automountServiceAccountToken` to false within the pod spec, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: examplesvcacct
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
----

Pods must include an explicit `serviceAccountName` in the pod spec. This is required to ensure that the pod is not automatically assigned the default service account.
