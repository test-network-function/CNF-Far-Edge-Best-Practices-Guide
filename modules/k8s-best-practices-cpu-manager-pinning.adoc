= CPU manager/pinning

The OpenShift platform can use the Kubernetes CPU Manager to support CPU pinning for applications.

Important note on using probes: If the workload is doing CPU pinning and running a DPDK process do
not use exec probes (executing a command within the container) as it may pile up and block the
node eventually.


Workload Requirement: If a workload is doing CPU pinning, exec probes may not be used.
