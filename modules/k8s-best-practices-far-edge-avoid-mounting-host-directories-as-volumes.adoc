= Avoid mounting host directories as volumes

It is not necessary to mount host /sys/ or host /dev/ directory as a volume in a pod in order to use a network device such as SR-IOV VF. The moving of a network interface into the pod network namespace is done automatically by CNI. Mounting the whole /sys/ or /dev/ directory in the container will overwrite the network device descriptor inside the container which causes 'device not found' or 'no such file or directory' error.

Network interface statistics can be queried inside the container using the same /sys/ path as was done when running directly on the host. When running network interfaces in containers, relevant /sys/ statistics interfaces are available inside the container, such as `/sys/class/net/net1/statistics/`, `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/tcp6`.

For running DPDK applications with SR-IOV VF, device specs (in case of vfio-pci) are automatically attached to the container via the Device Plugin. There is no need to mount the `/dev/` directory as a volume in the container as the application can find device specs under `/dev/vfio/` in the container.
