= Huge pages

In OpenShift Container Platform, nodes/hosts must pre-allocate huge pages.

For more information, see
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.html#cnf-configuring-huge-pages_cnf-master[Configuring huge pages].


To request hugepages, pods must supply the following within the `pod.spec` for each container:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  limits:
    hugepages-2Mi: 100Mi
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "1"
  requests:
    hugepages-2Mi: 100Mi
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "1"
