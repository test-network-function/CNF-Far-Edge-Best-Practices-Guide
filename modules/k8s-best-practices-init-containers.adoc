= init containers

init containers can be used for running tools or commands or any other action that needs to be done before the actual pod is started. For example, loading a database schema, or constructing a config file from a definition passed in via `ConfigMap` or `Secret`.

See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/nodes/containers/nodes-containers-init.html[Using init containers to perform tasks before a pod is deployed] for more information.
