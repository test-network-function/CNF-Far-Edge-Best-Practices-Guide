Log aggregation and analysis::
--
* Containers are expected to write logs to stdout. It is highly recommended that stdout/stderr leverage some standard logging format for output.
+
* Logs CAN be parsed to a limited extent so that specific vendor logs can be sent back to the workload if required.
+

* Logs need to be properly labeled for logsâ€™ consumer to correlate and process
+

* Workloads requiring log parsing must leverage some standard logging library or format for all stdout/stderr. Examples of standard logging libraries include; `klog`, `rfc5424`, and `oslo`.
