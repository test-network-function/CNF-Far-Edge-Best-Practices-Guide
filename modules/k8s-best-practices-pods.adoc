Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.

A Pod can contain one or more running containers at a time. Containers running in the same Pod have access to several of the same Linux namespaces. For example, each application has access to the same network namespace, meaning that one running container can communicate with another running container over `127.0.0.1:<port>`. The same is true for storage volumes so all containers are in the same Pod have access to the same mount namespace and can mount the same volumes.
