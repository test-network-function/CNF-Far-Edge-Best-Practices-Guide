Secrets objects in OpenShift provide a way to hold sensitive information such as passwords, config files and credentials. There are 4 types of secrets; service account, basic auth, ssh auth and TLS. Secrets can be added via deployment configurations or consumed by pods directly. For more information on secrets and examples, see the following documentation.
