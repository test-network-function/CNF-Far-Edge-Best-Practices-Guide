= Topology Manager and NUMA awareness

Topology Manager collects hints from the CPU Manager, Device Manager, and other Hint Providers to align pod resources, such as CPU, SR-IOV VFs, and other device resources, for all Quality of Service (QoS) classes on the same non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node. This topology information and the configured Topology manager policy determine whether a workload is accepted or rejected on a node.

[NOTE]
====
To align CPU resources with other requested resources in a Pod spec, the CPU Manager must be enabled with the static CPU Manager policy.
====

The following Topology manager policies are available and dependent on the requirements of the workload can be enabled. For high performance workloads making use of SR-IOV VFs, NUMA awareness follows the NUMA node to which the SR-IOV capable network adapter is connected.

Best-effort policy::
For each container in a pod with the best-effort topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not preferred, Topology Manager stores this and admits the pod to the node.

Restricted policy::
For each container in a pod with the restricted topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not preferred, Topology Manager rejects this pod from the node, resulting in a pod in a Terminated state with a pod admission failure.

Single NUMA node policy::
For each container in a pod with the single-numa-node topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager determines if a single NUMA Node affinity is possible. If it is, the pod is admitted to the node. If a single NUMA Node affinity is not possible, the Topology Manager rejects the pod from the node. This results in a pod in a Terminated state with a pod admission failure.
